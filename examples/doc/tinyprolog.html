<H1>LISPy things you can do in 64K&nbsp;bytes of core</H1>
<H2>Logic Programming</H2>

<P>No discussion of LISP would be complete without an implementation of PROLOG.
Naturally, an interpreter that can be fit in less than 7K nodes of LISP
memory cannot be very complex. The one discussed here is probably as small
and basic as a PROLOG interpreter can get. It is based on a tiny PROLOG
written by Ken Kahn in 1983 <A href="refs.html#7">[7]</A>. It originally
ran in MACLISP on a PDP-10.
The size of the <A href="prolog.html">interpreter</A> is really
surprising: less than 100 lines of code, about 2.5K bytes, and it
allocates less than 900 nodes of memory.
</P>

<P>PROLOG is interesting, because it performs logical inference and
backtracking, i.e. it will derive facts that were not explicitly given
to it and it will systematically find <EM>all</EM> solutions to a given
problem.
</P>

<P>The following programs will be presented as databases of "clauses"
(facts and rules) and all expressions submitted to PROLOG will be assumed
to be <EM>queries</EM>. For example,
</P>

<PRE class=program>
(quote ((man socrates)))
</PRE>

<P>would be a "fact" that states that Socrates is a man, and

<PRE class=program>
(quote ((mortal (// x)) (man (// x))))
</PRE>

<P>would be a "rule" stating that "X is mortal, if X is a man". A rule is
a sequence of "terms", where the first one is the "head" of the rule
and and the subsequent ones, called "goals", form the "body" of the rule.
A rule basically says, in order to prove the head, prove all goals
of the body. Using PROLOG syntax, the above program would look like
this:</P>

<PRE>
man(socrates).
mortal(X) :- man(X).
</PRE>

<P>A "fact" is just a rule with an empty body: nothing needs to be proven
for the rule to be true.
</P>

<P>
Given a database containing the above rules, queries can be submitted to
PROLOG. (Below, Themistoclea is added to the database, who is mortal,
but not a man.)
</P>

<PRE class=program>
* (load 'src//<A href="prolog.html">prolog</A>)
t

* (setq db '(((man socrates))
             ((mortal themistoclea))
             ((mortal (// x)) (man (// x)))))
db

* (prolog db '(man socrates))
                                   ; <SPAN class=hl>mind the gap!</SPAN>
nil

* (prolog db '(man aristotle))
nil                                ; <SPAN class=hl>no blank line here!</SPAN>

* (prolog db '(mortal (// who)))

who = themistoclea

who = socrates
nil

* _
</PRE>

<P>The first query, <CODE>(man socrates)</CODE>, asks the system, "is
Socrates a man?" and PROLOG answers "yes" by printing a blank line. Yes,
the interface is minimalistic! The next query asks if Aristotle is a man,
to which the system responds "no" (by not printing a blank line). Of
course, Aristotle is a man, but this cannot be inferred from the rules
in the database, so the answer is no.
</P>

<P>The final query asks "who is mortal?", where the expression
<CODE>(// who)</CODE> denotes the variable "who".  The query delivers
the answers "who = themistoclea" and "who = socrates". The fact that
Themistoclea is mortal is contained in the database, but the fact that
Socrates is mortal was inferred from the fact that he is a man and the
rule stating that men are mortal.
</P>

<P>The basic functionality of the PROLOG system is contained in four
functions of about 30 lines of code in total. The
<A href="prolog.html#unify">UNIFY</A> function attempts to unify two
terms. Unification is a little bit like pattern matching: it compares
two terms, which are LISP lists, and binds variables contained
in one term to the corresponding counterparts in the other term. UNIFY is
written in LISP, so it can be explored interactively:
</P>

<PRE class=program>
* (unify '(foo bar baz)
         '(foo bar baz) '((bottom)))
((bottom))

* (unify '(foo bar baz)
         '(foo baz wrong) '((bottom)))
nil

* (unify '((// foo)  bar)
         '(foo-value bar) '((bottom)))
(((/ foo) foo-value) (bottom))

* (unify '((// foo) (// foo))
         '(first    second)   '((bottom)))
nil
</PRE>

<P>The third argument of UNIFY is an environment in which variables are
bound to values. <CODE>((Bottom))</CODE> is the empty environment.
When the two terms of UNIFY match, it returns a new environment,
and otherwise it returns NIL. In the third example above, unification
succeeds and binds FOO to FOO-VALUE. The last example first binds
FOO to FIRST and then attempts to bind FOO to SECOND&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but
FOO is already bound to FIRST, so this is a contradiction and unification
fails.
</P>

<P>Variables can bind to variables, too, making those variables the
same (or, more correctly, making them <EM>co-refer</EM> to the same value):
</P>

<PRE class=program>
* (unify '((// foo))
         '((// bar)) '((bottom)))
(((/ foo) (/ bar)) (bottom))

* (unify '((// foo) (// bar))
         '(first    second)
	 '(((// foo) (// bar)) (bottom)))
nil
</PRE>

<P>Here the second unification fails, because it binds FOO and BAR to
different values, but the environment says that FOO and BAR co-refer,
i.e. they <EM>must</EM> refer to the same value.
</P>

<P>The <A href="prolog.html#try">TRY</A> function attempts to prove a
clause (GOALS) in an environment (E) given a database (DB). The
variable RULES points to a clause in the database. N is for renaming
variables, but explaining this at this point would be a major detour.
</P>

<P>What TRY basically does is this: unify the head of the first rule
R1 in the database with the head of the given clause (GOALS). When
unification fails, try the next rule. When unification succeeds,
giving a new environment NE, try to prove the concatenation of the
bodies of R1 and GOALS in NE. When the proof does not succeed, try
the next rule in the database. When running out of rules, return NIL.
</P>

<P>The <A href="prolog.html#prove">PROVE</A> function just passes its
variables to TRY, but in addition it prints the current "frame" when
an empty clause is passed to it. A "frame" is a list of all instantiations
(bindings) of the variables contained in a query. An empty clause means
that there is nothing to prove, so the values bound to the variables
form a valid solution.
</P>

<P>The <A href="prolog.html#prolog">PROLOG</A> function merely passes
the given database and query (GOALS) to PROVE and provides some initial
values, such as an empty environment.
</P>

<P>Here are some more queries, this time using the
<A href="prolog.html#genealogy">genealogy database</A> from the
original source code:
</P>

<PRE class=program>
* ; who is the father of Ken?
  (prolog db '(father (// who) ken))
 
who = jack
nil

* ; who is the grandchild of Cele?
  (prolog db '(grandparent cele (// who)))

who = ken

who = karen
nil

* ; who is parent to whom?
  (prolog db '(parent (// parent) (// child)))
 
child = ken
parent = el
 
child = jack
parent = cele
 
child = ken
parent = jack
 
child = karen
parent = jack
nil
</PRE>

<P>The last query is particularly interesting, because each frame
printed as a solution contains multiple variables, i.e. the PROLOG
system prints all valid parent/child combinations that can be
inferred from the clauses in the database.
</P>

<P>A <A href="prolog.html#mod">minor modification</A> allows the tiny
PROLOG system to operate on lists, thereby supporting clauses like this:
</P>

<PRE class=program>
; In PROLOG:
; append([], L, L).
; append([X|Xs], Ys, [X|Zs]) :- append(Xs, Ys, Zs).

(setq db
  '(((append nil (// l) (// l)))
    ((append ((// x) . (// xs)) (// ys) ((// x) . (// zs)))
     (append (// xs) (// ys) (// zs)))))
</PRE>

<P>The APPEND goal appends the lists X and Y, instantiating Z with the
result. Being a PROLOG goal, though, there are even more interesting things
you can do with APPEND:
</P>

<PRE class=program>
; what is '(a b c) concatenated to '(d e f)?
* (prolog db '(append (a b c) (d e f) (// list)))

list = (a b c d e f)
nil

; what prepended to '(d e f) gives '(a b c d e f)?
* (prolog db '(append (// what) (d e f) (a b c d e f)))

what = (a b c)
nil

; what appended to what gives '(a b c)?
(prolog db '(append (// a) (// b) (a b c)))
 
b = (a b c)
a = nil
 
b = (b c)
a = (a)
 
b = (c)
a = (a b)
 
b = nil
a = (a b c)
nil
</PRE>

<P>So a basic PROLOG system can be implemented in 7K nodes of LISP
memory with lots of leeway. What about <A href="eval.html">LISP itself</A>?
